# DinoCV

It was Friday night, and I mindlessly open my laptop to while away time
online. But my internet connection had other plans, the T-Rex runner (or the Dino game as it is
popularly known) greeted me. Being a tronix enthusiast, I decided to make it
attractive. So here’s what I did!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Discription 

* Have yellow colour markers on each of the two pointer and thumb fingers.
* An action of a pinch with those two fingers will translate to the Dino jumping.
* If you show the gesture of 2 ‘L’s (to form a square) with your fingers and the correct orientation of colour markers , a screenshot of the game screen will be saved.
